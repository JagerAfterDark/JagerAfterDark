Heyya! my names Jager and im a transgirl 🤍🩷💙 minecraft programmer and generally a computer fanatic 😸 I try to learn all my knowledge by myself via trial and error, so if I know something it means ive messed it up badly before 💔\

+ ⛥ Furry Fandom 🐾
> I love furries sm 💚 one of the fandoms ive interacted with for the longest and its easily my favorite!! the most welcoming community ive ever been in and honestly made me a more creative person by proxy. although despite that I still havent made a sona which GOD DAM I need to tf 💔

+ Rainbow Six Siege ⌨️
> quite the curve ball of an interest but even at my youngest ages I loved FPS games, I wasnt actually ment to be introduced to siege but my brother left the disk out on the counter one day and I just shovedd into out xbox. from that day ive played for 7 years and its still my favorite FPS game, though my peak is being a 1.7kd Emerald 🥹
